Case Study: Application for smart education system

Step 1: We have chosen to do an improvised and innovative application over the existing education system which can enhance the learning ability of the students and their imagination.

Step 2: The existing system can be upgraded with Virtual Reality(VR) which will enhance the imagination of the students and also make understanding things more clear and better.

Step 3:

Step 4: We have tried to create a sample model by converting few 2-D images into 3-D images using ‘Unity’ and created an app for the same. The snapshots of the same are provided below:

Select the Input Component (Camera):
The user has to point his mobile's camera towards the input objects to get the final output.
the INPUT OBJECTS are:

Obtaining the Output: 
After the previous step the user confirms the input component using which the system operates. 
The user hold the input image containing the marker in front of the camera. 
The system scans the input image and searches the previously stored images in the defined database. 
After completion of the search the system find the most accurate result corresponding to the input image. 
Using the previous result the 3d model associated with the marker is mounted at the point specified by the programmer. 
Final output of the mounted 3d model is displayed on the screen which is visible to the end user as an augmented object.

This was just a set of few images which we used to experiment. This technology can used with real-time textbooks of various grades and the images can be stored in the database to provide 3-D view for better learning. 

For eg:

The above image is our imagination how it can be used for education. Complicated 2-D designs can be understood easier if it is visible in 3-D. 
The application can be used from kindergarten to higher level studies.
Best application of this prototype can be in medical field and for engineering drawing where the diagrams are too difficult and complicated to understand in 2-D.

Step 5: We have not done usability testing, since, this was just done with some random images and not with any real-time textbooks or journals. But the technology remains same for any kind of 2-D diagram, images or structures.
